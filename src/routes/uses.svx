### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To build this site 
- [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) is a framework on top [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) helps to make static site,
- and use [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- this website hosted as static site on [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
- and I get that cool domain name from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
- For Newsletter I'm using [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) free plan 
from [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
- Use Markdown for blogging and content pages using [Mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io) package. 

### ‚öôÔ∏è  Development environment
- [Manjaro](http://manjaro.org/) distribution as my main OS + [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) version.
- [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim): is my main Editor for almost every thing using some cool plugins, e.g: NERDTree, Coc.vim ..
- I'm also still using [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to fix git conflicts beacasue my brain not smart enough to fix conflicts without GUI.
- Most of my programmes are [Suckless](https://suckless.org/rocks/) so I'm using [St](https://st.suckless.org/) terminal
with [zsh + oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) shell.
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) really helps me to me fouce on only one opned terminal.
- [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) theme for my editor & [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline).

### ü•û Tech Stack
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as my main frontend framework.
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is the best PWA framework and its plugin architecture is very powerfull.
- for styling I'm using css-in-js, [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), 
and [Styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) are my friends.
- If I will go to use a css framework, for sure I'll use [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- I prefer using native solution for state management like [useState/useReducer/useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), 
but I've worked on projects using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/), and [Apollo State](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/local-state/).
- I developed couple of Mobile Apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
- I also enjoying write backend stuff using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), 
[Type-graphql](https://typegraphql.ml/), and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/).
- Recently [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) became on of my favourite javascript frameworks.
